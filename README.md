# advent_of_code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language of one's choice. 
Each day one puzzle is given, and each puzzle consists of two parts. This repo keeps track of my solutions in Python to each day's puzzle.
In this project the speed of solving puzzles was prioritized than optimization of the code, due to limited free time.
